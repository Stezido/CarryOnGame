# CarryOnGame
A Game which I was programming for 2 months. With this project I just wanted to refresh my Game Dev skills.
It is built with gradle but it can only be played on desktop.
I dont know what's the best way to share my game for playing. I guess its a .bin file, but I have to change my paths so I dont get a FileNotFoundException when starting the bin File.
