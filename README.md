# CarryOnGame
A Game which I was programming for 2 months. With this project I just wanted to refresh my Game Dev skills.
It is built with gradle but it can only be played on desktop.
I dont know what's the best way to share my game for playing. I guess its a .bin file, but I have to change my paths so I dont get a FileNotFoundException when starting the bin File.

How to play the Game?

1.extract the CarryOnGame.jar File (with 7Zip or something - otherwise there will be a FileNotFoundException)
2. start the CarryOnGame.jar
3.play ;)
